To run on windows download the folder in the 'Windows' folder. DO NOT REMOVE THE .EXE FROM THE FOLDER. THE GAME REQUIRES EVERYTHING TO BE IN THE FOLDER IN ORDER TO RUN. Run the .exe in the folder. There are 32 and 64 bit specific versions. If you're not sure if your system is 64 bit or not, try running the 64 bit version. If it fails to run, then try the 32 bit version instead.
